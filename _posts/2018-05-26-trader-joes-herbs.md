Last week I was in Trader Joe's, and I noticed they had herbs for $1.99. They weren't just the one-shot variety, but potted and ready to plant.

I was able to get them planted this morning. They look and smell amazing, so hopefully they take off.

I then went through and trimmed the plants this morning and gave them a bit of fertilizer. Lot's of the tomatoes have outgrown the small clips I was using, so I had to upgrade them to the large ones. There are some blooms, but no tomatoes yet.

So our basil last year went to seed at the end of the season. Apparently a lot of that took, and we have a ton of baby volunteer basil.
