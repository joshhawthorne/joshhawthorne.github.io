It's Memorial Day. I feel like the older I get the more the holidays just speed by. It is so easy to forget why we celebrate. Here's a link to a pretty good article talking about the history of Memorial Day.

[Why We Celebrate Memorial Day](http://time.com/3892630/why-do-we-celebrate-memorial-day/)

And to summarize, "Memorial Day is a solemn day of remembrance for everyone who has died serving in the American armed forces."

My grandfather served in WWII. He did not die while serving, but he sure had a lot of friends who did. I know if he were here today he would be thinking fondly of them.
